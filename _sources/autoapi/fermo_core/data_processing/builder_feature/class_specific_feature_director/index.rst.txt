.. py:module:: fermo_core.data_processing.builder_feature.class_specific_feature_director

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Direct the creation of an instance of a sample-specific feature

   These features are created with sample-specific information (e.g. retention time,
   which can be different in each sample). This is different to generalized features,
   which contain average values across samples.

.. py:class:: SpecificFeatureDirector

   Directs the construction of the sample-specific Feature instance


   .. py:method:: construct_mzmine3(row: pandas.Series, s_id: str, max_intensity: int, max_area: int) -> fermo_core.data_processing.builder_feature.dataclass_feature.Feature
      :staticmethod:


      Construct the Feature product instance.

      Args:
          row: a pandas series containing feature information
          s_id: indicating the sample identifier
          max_intensity: the highest intensity of the molecular feature in sample
          max_area: the highest area of the molecular feature in sample

      Returns:
          An instance of the Feature class.
